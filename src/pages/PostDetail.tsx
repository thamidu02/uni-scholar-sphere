    "I'm currently studying for the Advanced Algorithms course and looking for supplementary materials beyond the textbook. Can anyone recommend some good resources? I'm particularly interested in graph algorithms and dynamic programming techniques.\n\nI've already gone through the lecture notes and practiced the problems in the textbook, but I feel I need more challenging exercises to really master these concepts before the exam next month.\n\nAny recommendations for online courses, YouTube channels, or practice problem sets would be greatly appreciated!",
